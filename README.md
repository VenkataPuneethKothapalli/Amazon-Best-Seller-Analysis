## ‚öôÔ∏è Analysis Performed (`main.py`)

The `main.py` script executes the following key steps:

1.  **Data Loading & Cleaning**:
    * Loads `bestsellers.csv`.
    * Removes **duplicate entries** (as a book can be a bestseller in multiple years).
    * Renames columns for clarity: "Name" ‚Üí **"Title"**, "User Rating" ‚Üí **"Rating"**, "Year" ‚Üí **"Publication Year"**.
    * Converts the "Price" column to a float data type.

2.  **Author Popularity Analysis**:
    * Calculates the frequency of each author's appearance on the bestseller list (`Author.value_counts()`).
    * Exports the top 10 authors to `top_authors.csv`.

3.  **Genre Rating Comparison**:
    * Calculates the **average user rating** by grouping the data by "Genre" (`groupby("Genre")`).
    * Exports the results to `avg_rating_by_genre.csv`.
